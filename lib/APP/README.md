# Service

This is where you are going to start the server, frontend and backend from.

The simple `docker-compose` file will allow you to start the graphql server, the react frontend and a simple psql database.

All of them hooked up and ready to go.

Bonus: You also get hot reloading out of the box, so any changes made on your host machine, will be reflected inside the containers.
