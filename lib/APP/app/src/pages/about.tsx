Then we moved onto creating backend solutions for our clients. Suddenly we realized that there was a demand for complete end-to-end solutions, be it apps or websites, with or without backends.

                    Our clients started coming with their business needs and we designed complete solutions for them - instead of just mobile apps. Then we started doing more things: websites, web apps, research, API design, E-commerce integration, serious stuff! — and suddenly we found ourselves running an inventive product design company which also happens to be good with production.</p>

                        When choosing the name, we wanted something unique, and close to home. We considered different names and gravitated towards things to do with nature, the Rocky Mountains, and Calgary's position on the foothills of the Rockies. After contemplating on lots of different names, we arrived at the Latin word mons, but it wasn't quite quirky enough. <br/> <br/>To add a litte more pizzaz we deicded to add another <span className="font-william italic">s</span>. Thus, the name monss was born.
